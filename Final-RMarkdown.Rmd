# ABSTRACT

# BACKGROUND
Cancer stem cells are tumor cells that undergo self-renewal and differentiation (Jaggupilli and Elkord, 2012). Past research has linked these cancer stem cells to the initiation and maintenance of a tumor. The CD24 surface marker is present on cancer stem cells, and is thus used to identify and isolate these cancer stem cells. 

Research investigating the expression of genes related to the CD24 surface marker (called the CD24 gene in this report) will help us better understand the causal or correlative role this gene plays in breast cancer. 

# STUDY QUESTION AND HYPOTHESIS

## QUESTIONS
How much does gene expression of CD24 differ between human cancer breast tissue and normal human breast tissue?

## HYPOTHESIS
The expression of CD24 will differ significantly between tumor breast tissue and normal breast tissue.

## PREDICTION
We predict that the expression of CD24 will be increased in tumor breast tissue. 

# METHODS
Bong et al. collected total RNAs from individuals with breast cancer and normal tissues. The total RNAs were processed and hybridized on an oligonucleotide array chip (specifically the Affymetrix genechip U133A) for 16 hours. There was a total of 86 sets of gene expression data. Of these 86 sets, 43 were from individuals with breast tumors and 43 were from individuals with normal breast tissue. The differences in gene expression between the tumor and normal groups was compared using paired t-test (Bong et al., 2010). The Bonferroni multiple test correction was used to adjust the P-values for the false discovery rate.

The data was processed and analyzed using the GEO2R software. Geo2R uses a variety of R packages - including DESeq2, GEOquery, and limma (Linear Models for Microarray Analysis) - to perform differential expression analysis using series matrix data. 

To analyze the data using the GEO2R software, we entered the series accession number (GSE15852) and defined our sample groups (tumor breast tissue vs normal breast tissue). 

## FIRST ANALYSIS AND PLOT

I am still working on the code for the plot. It is having a hard time knitting.
