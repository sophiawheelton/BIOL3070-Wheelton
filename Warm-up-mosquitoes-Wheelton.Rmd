# ABSTRACT
West Nile Virus is potentially deadly upon infection. Mosquitoes get infected upon consuming a blood meal from certain birds and then transmitting it to their next blood meal host. These hosts could be other birds, or they could be humans. We sought to determine if there was a relationship between house finches and West Nile Virus in Salt Lake City. Specifically, we determined if house finches were important amplifying hosts of West Nile Virus. Analysis of house finch populations in areas (hot spots) with and without West Nile Virus visually suggested a relationship. This relationship was further statistically confirmed with a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) statistical test. The test showed that there was a significant difference between house finch blood meal counts in locations with and without West Nile Virus, implying that the relationship between house finches and West Nile Virus is predictive, and that the house finches are acting as amplifying hosts. As the blood meal counts of house finches in locations with West Nile virus is much larger than the blood meal counts of other birds in the same location, we can infer that house finches are especially important for amplification. 

# BACKGROUND
West Nile Virus is typically spread from certain bird species to mosquitoes and back again. The mosquito collects a blood meal from an infected bird and then infects their next blood meal. While that next blood meal is typically a bird, the mosquito can also affect people and horses accidentally. In people, West Nile Virus is generally manageable. However, in some cases, it results in death. Research into the transmittability of West Nile Virus is important to help manage West Nile outbreaks and to educate the public so they can help protect themselves. 

A lot of th research related to West Nile Virus analyzes blood meal counts of different hosts of West Nile virus. To do this, DNA must be extracted and identified. PCR amplifies the extracted DNA through several cycles of heating and cooling in a Thermocycler. The DNA is denatured so that a primer can bind to it. DNA polymerase then replicates the strand. This denaturation and replication happens several times until there is enough DNA to be sequenced ("Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fact sheet", 2020). Sequencing can then be completed using numerous methods. MinION sequencing uses a nanopore sequencer to sequence the DNA, which is compiled using base-calling and aligned using read counting and a reference gene sequences. The cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene is used to compare different species and individuals within a species. The COI can be identified using the GenBank database.

By analyzing the DNA sequences of the blood meals of mosquitoes, the hosts of the West Nile Virus-infected mosquitoes can be identified. Using the viremia duration (Kumar et al., 2003) bar plot, we can visually determine the importance of house finches in WNV transmission. This provides the foundation for our hypothesis and prediction that house finches are important to the amplification of West Nile Virus, and that locations with more house finches will be predictive of West Nile Virus hot spots. 

The relationship between certain bird species and West Nile Virus transmission is crucial for prevention efforts. By knowing how the virus is spread, we can pay more attention to certain bird population locations and focus our preventative measures in those areas.

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions  
What bird species is acting as WNV amplifying host in Salt Lake City?

## Hypothesis 
House finches are acting as important amplifying hosts of WNV in Salt Lake City.
  
## Prediction
If house finches are acting as important amplifying hosts, we predict that trapping locations where mosquitoes feed on house finches will also have higher rates of confirmed WNV in tested mosquito pools. 

# METHODS
Mosquitoes were collected from several locations. We extracted blood meal DNA from a sample of mosquitoes, both with West Nile Virus and without. We then pipetted the collected DNA and controls into the wells of the PCR plate. A primer and DNA polymerase was added and the DNA was replicated in a Thermocycler. Using MinION sequencing, the mosquito COI sequence was compiled. We identified the DNA sequences using the NCBI BLASTn tool in the GenBank database. Finally, we plotted the data and performed a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) statistical test to analyze the results. 

## First Analysis and Plot
```{r first-analysis, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width=4.75, fig.height=7}
```

Horizontal plots:
```{r horiz-plot,fig.align='left',fig.width=7,fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
#This code creates a plot showing the frequency of different bird species at locations with and without West Nile Virus.
## import counts_matrix: data.frame with column 'loc_positives' (0/1) and host columns 'host_*'
counts_matrix <- read.csv("./bloodmeal_plusWNV_for_BIOL3070.csv")

## 1) Identify host columns
host_cols <- grep("^host_", names(counts_matrix), value = TRUE)

if (length(host_cols) == 0) {
  stop("No columns matching '^host_' were found in counts_matrix.")
}

## 2) Ensure loc_positives is present and has both levels 0 and 1 where possible
counts_matrix$loc_positives <- factor(counts_matrix$loc_positives, levels = c(0, 1))

## 3) Aggregate host counts by loc_positives
agg <- stats::aggregate(
  counts_matrix[, host_cols, drop = FALSE],
  by = list(loc_positives = counts_matrix$loc_positives),
  FUN = function(x) sum(as.numeric(x), na.rm = TRUE)
)

## make sure both rows exist; if one is missing, add a zero row
need_levels <- setdiff(levels(counts_matrix$loc_positives), as.character(agg$loc_positives))
if (length(need_levels)) {
  zero_row <- as.list(rep(0, length(host_cols)))
  names(zero_row) <- host_cols
  for (lv in need_levels) {
    agg <- rbind(agg, c(lv, zero_row))
  }
  ## restore proper type
  agg$loc_positives <- factor(agg$loc_positives, levels = c("0","1"))
  ## coerce numeric host cols (they may have become character after rbind)
  for (hc in host_cols) agg[[hc]] <- as.numeric(agg[[hc]])
  agg <- agg[order(agg$loc_positives), , drop = FALSE]
}

## 4) Decide species order (overall abundance, descending)
overall <- colSums(agg[, host_cols, drop = FALSE], na.rm = TRUE)
host_order <- names(sort(overall, decreasing = TRUE))
species_labels <- rev(sub("^host_", "", host_order))  # nicer labels

## 5) Build count vectors for each panel in the SAME order
counts0 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 0, host_order, drop = TRUE]))
counts1 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 1, host_order, drop = TRUE]))

## 6) Colors: reuse your existing 'cols' if it exists and is long enough; otherwise generate
if (exists("cols") && length(cols) >= length(host_order)) {
  species_colors <- setNames(cols[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
} else {
  species_colors <- setNames(rainbow(length(host_order) + 10)[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
}

## 7) Shared x-limit for comparability
xmax <- max(c(counts0, counts1), na.rm = TRUE)
xmax <- if (is.finite(xmax)) xmax else 1
xlim_use <- c(0, xmax * 1.08)

## 8) Plot: two horizontal barplots with identical order and colors
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
          mar = c(4, 12, 3, 2),  # big left margin for species names
          xaxs = "i")           # a bit tighter axis padding

## Panel A: No WNV detected (loc_positives = 0)
barplot(height = counts0,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (-)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

## Panel B: WNV detected (loc_positives = 1)
barplot(height = counts1,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (+)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

par(op)

## Keep the colors mapping for reuse elsewhere
host_species_colors <- species_colors
```

## Second Analysis
```{r second-analysis-or-plot, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width=4.75, fig.height=7}
#This code is for a Generalized Linear Model statistical test. The test determines whether the presence or number of house finch blood meals predicts whether a site had WNV-positive pools (binary) or a higher WNV positivity rate (numeric). This test is a formal evaluation of the relationship suggested in the plot from the first analysis. 

# second-analysis-or-plot, glm with house finch alone against binary +/_
glm1 <- glm(loc_positives ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix,
            family = binomial)
summary(glm1)

#glm with house-finch alone against positivity rate
glm2 <- glm(loc_rate ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix)
summary(glm2)
```


# DISCUSSION
Overall, we found that there was a significant relationship between house finch populations and locations for West Nile Virus. This implies that house finches are important to the spread of West Nile Virus. However, there might be other confounding variables that might result in an increased population of both. For example, in suburban areas, there would be a higher population of house finches and a higher concentration of West Nile Virus in general. This would weaken the statistical connection between the two. Additional research should be done to analyze potential confounding variables. A possible limitation is that the data is only about Salt Lake City. The relationship should not be applied outside of the Salt Lake City Valley without further research. 

## Interpretation of First Analysis
Visually, there is a significantly greater number of house finches (blood meal counts) in locations with West Nile Virus than there are in locations without. This plot shows that there is a relationship between house finches and West Nile Virus. While this could indicated that house finches are important in the spread of West Nile Virus, without performing a statistical test, we cannot claim that the relationship is not based on chance. The plot also does not tell us whether house finches can be predictive of West Nile Virus.

## Interpretation of Second Analysis
This GLM statistical test shows us that the relationship between house finches (blood meal counts) and West Nile Virus is significant. Specifically, the p-values are both significant at 6.07e-15 and 4.54e-05. This means that more house finches will be associated with and predictive of more West Nile Virus, and that house finches are an important amplifying host for West Nile Virus in Salt Lake City.

# CONCLUSION
We found a statistically significant link between house finches population and hot spots for West Nile Virus when compared to house finch populations without West Nile Virus. This relationship is predictive. This shows that finches are acting as important amplifying hosts of West Nile Virus in Salt Lake City. Additional research should be done to identify and account for other confounding variables that might be present, or if the relationship is applicable outside the Salt Lake City Valley. Knowing what birds relate to increased spreadability of West Nile Virus can help us with certain preventative measures. Increased public awareness of the presence of certain bird species (i.e. house finches) in an area might help make people more aware of the risk of contracting West Nile Virus. This would further encourage them to protect themselves against mosquitoes during high-risk seasons for West Nile Virus.
